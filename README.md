# Settle

## The programmable spending card for AI agents.

**Caps. Allowlists. Expiry. Instant revoke.** Every payment leaves a four-hash receipt on Solana that anyone can re-derive in a browser tab. No Settle server in the trust path; on-chain policy enforcement is independent of our database.

Settle is the trust layer that sits between humans and the AI agents they hand a budget to. It also works for plain consumer USDC sends and merchant accept-payments flows — but the spine is the agent card.

## Try it in 2 minutes

No install needed. All four work on devnet right now:

1. **Watch an agent spend** → [`/watch`](https://use-settle.vercel.app/watch) — real ALLOW / DENY decisions stream live; click any row to open the on-chain receipt.
2. **Send a payment** → [`/start/consumer`](https://use-settle.vercel.app/start/consumer) — connect Phantom, take a sandbox airdrop, send to `@alice`.
3. **Hire your own agent** → [`/start/agent`](https://use-settle.vercel.app/start/agent) — pick a budget and what it can buy; revoke in one tx.
4. **Verify a receipt without us** → paste `ca50ca04e587acecbfefdab0bfdcee5351a521f33797d201417a9c3a238cc902` into [`/verify`](https://use-settle.vercel.app/verify) — the SDK re-derives all 4 BLAKE3 hashes in your browser tab.

```

Same primitive runs the cross-chain extension: Settle's policy gate evaluates on Solana, [Ika dWallets](https://ika.xyz) produce the signature for the target chain, the hash chain still settles on Solana. See [`docs/IKA-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/IKA-INTEGRATION.md).

---

## Verify a receipt in five lines

```ts
import { verifyReceipt } from "@settle/sdk";

const v = verifyReceipt({ receipt, reason, policy_snapshot, http, expected });

if (v.ok) console.log("All 4 hashes match — payment is provable.");
else      console.error("Tampering detected:", v.mismatches);
```

`receipt`, `reason`, `policy_snapshot` come from your DB row or the receipt poster JSON. `expected` is the four hashes from on-chain (Solscan or any RPC). `verifyReceipt` is a pure function. It runs in a browser tab, an Edge worker, or a CI pipeline. No Settle service is needed for the verification step; the deployed Anchor program is the only authority you have to trust.

Settle ships SDKs in three runtimes:

- **TypeScript** — [`@settle/sdk`](packages/sdk) (in-monorepo, used by the Settle web app, indexer, and reference agent). Public npm companions: [`create-settle-merchant`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-settle-merchant) (scaffold CLI) and [`@settle-web/web-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settle-web/web-components) (`<settle-pay>` and `<settle-verify>` custom elements).
- **Python** — [`settle-protocol-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/settle-protocol-sdk/) **published on PyPI**. Includes the receipt kernel, `verifyReceipt`, and adapters for LangChain and CrewAI.
- **Rust** — [`packages/rust-sdk`](packages/rust-sdk) (in-monorepo crate for on-chain consumers and CLI tools).

### Same hashes, three runtimes

```ts
// TypeScript — packages/sdk
import { verifyReceipt } from "@settle/sdk";
const v = verifyReceipt({ receipt, reason, policy_snapshot, http, expected });
// v.ok === true ⇒ all 4 hashes match
```

```python
# Python — pip install settle-protocol-sdk
from settle_sdk import verify_receipt
v = verify_receipt({"receipt": r, "reason": s, "policy_snapshot": p,
                    "http": h, "expected": e})
# v.ok is True ⇒ all 4 hashes match
```

```rust
// Rust — packages/rust-sdk
use settle_sdk::verify_receipt;
let v = verify_receipt(&VerifyInput { receipt, reason, policy_snapshot,
                                      purpose_input, expected });
// v.ok ⇒ all 4 hashes match
```

All three call sites compute the same 4 BLAKE3 hashes from the same canonical-JSON encoding. Cross-language parity is enforced by [`packages/python-sdk/test_kernel_parity.py`](packages/python-sdk/test_kernel_parity.py) and [`test_parity.py`](packages/python-sdk/test_parity.py): the Python suite hashes shared fixtures and compares against precomputed TS + Rust outputs.

#### Run the parity demo yourself

One command runs the receipt kernel in all three SDKs against a locked input and prints the side-by-side hashes:

```bash
pnpm demo:parity
```

```
hash                  TypeScript        Python            Rust              match
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
receipt_hash          095a40c24988…     095a40c24988…     095a40c24988…       ✓
reason_hash           320e5f7ee4bd…     320e5f7ee4bd…     320e5f7ee4bd…       ✓
policy_snapshot_hash  203bceb4b5d4…     203bceb4b5d4…     203bceb4b5d4…       ✓
purpose_hash          ac9a1f2e6aad…     ac9a1f2e6aad…     ac9a1f2e6aad…       ✓
context_hash          6bb849195e12…     6bb849195e12…     6bb849195e12…       ✓

✓ All 5 hashes match across TypeScript, Python, and Rust.
```

The same canonical input goes through `packages/sdk` (TypeScript), `packages/python-sdk` (Python, also published on PyPI as `settle-protocol-sdk`), and `packages/rust-sdk` (Rust). Five separate BLAKE3 hashes per receipt, all five identical across runtimes. This is the proof behind the "byte-identical SDK parity" claim and is reproducible by any reviewer in under 60 seconds.

Every receipt — happy path or deny — commits the same four BLAKE3 hashes on Solana. Anyone with the receipt JSON can re-derive them in their browser.

## Settle × Ika · cross-chain custody

> Solana defines the policy. Ika enforces custody and signing across chains. Settle shows proof of what was allowed, blocked, signed, and executed.

A sibling Anchor 1.0 program (`programs-ika/settle-dwallet-router`) extends the policy gate to any chain Ika supports. Day-one chain: Ethereum Sepolia.

| Asset | Where | Verifiable |
|---|---|---|
| Router program | `FNpdUSsk9xzrFR1qsDnE17KaAYA95YwGCtiuKbTa7qSK` | [Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/FNpdUSsk9xzrFR1qsDnE17KaAYA95YwGCtiuKbTa7qSK?cluster=devnet) |
| Cross-chain UI | `/start/agent-crosschain`, `/cards/crosschain/<pda>`, `/watch-crosschain` | live |
| Tests | 68 across the integration (15 Rust + 12 SDK + 11 validation + 21 EIP-1559 + 9 Playwright) | all green |

Full integration story: [`docs/IKA-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/IKA-INTEGRATION.md). Test evidence: [`docs/IKA-TEST-REPORT.md`](docs/IKA-TEST-REPORT.md).

> **Status note.** The Settle-side router program, policy gate, and EIP-1559 receipt envelope are deployed and unit-tested on devnet (15/15 router tests, 21/21 EIP-1559 tests). Live cross-chain signing through the Ika dWallet network is currently blocked on their pre-alpha gRPC endpoint (NGHTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR / ALPN handshake failure across Node and Bun, [`docs/IKA-TEST-REPORT.md`](docs/IKA-TEST-REPORT.md)). The Settle-side architecture is independently verifiable today; the round-trip will go live as Ika promotes to a stable RPC.

## What's shipped

A non-exhaustive view of what runs today on devnet:

### On-chain · Solana, Anchor 0.31
- `settle-agent-card` program — 15 instructions, hash-committed receipts, atomic policy enforcement, deployed at [`HU4piq8…77nD`](https://solscan.io/account/HU4piq8bwYFast81U6e8huYVb8JaY44chWE8QVGT77nD?cluster=devnet)
- AgentCard PDA with per-call cap · daily cap · allowlist · capability pin · expiry · revocation — all enforced atomically in one instruction

### Solana primitives composed
**On-chain:** Anchor 0.31 · SPL Token + ATA · SPL Memo · Solana Pay · Compressed NFTs (Bubblegum V1) · Address Lookup Tables · Versioned transactions · Lighthouse tx assertions · MPL Core soulbound badges · Light Protocol compressed tokens.

**Off-chain:** Helius RPC + WebSocket · Helius Sender (priority transaction submission) · Jupiter Lite (quote + swap) · Pyth Hermes · Photon RPC (compressed accounts) · Solana Attestation Service · Solana Actions / Blinks · VAPID Web Push · jsQR + Solana Pay URL parsing.

Eighteen Solana primitives composed under one policy gate. Every decision the gate makes, ALLOW or DENY, commits a hash-anchored receipt anyone can verify in their browser.

## Architecture

The on-chain core is the `settle-agent-card` Anchor 0.31 program (15 instructions). A sibling program, `settle-dwallet-router` (Anchor 1.0), extends the policy gate cross-chain via Ika. Hash-committed receipts. USDC mint pinned at create-time. Per-call cap, daily cap, allowlist, capability pin, expiry, and revocation are all enforced atomically in one ix, removing the TOCTOU window between policy decision and transfer.

<details>
<summary><b>Instruction list (14)</b></summary>

`create_card`, `spend`, `spend_via_pact`, `revoke`, `record_denial`, `open_pact`, `close_pact`,
`open_streaming_pact`, `claim_streaming`, `pause_streaming`, `resume_streaming`,
`open_delivery_escrow`, `release_delivery_escrow`, `dispute_delivery_escrow`.

`Pact.mode` is a `PactMode` enum: `OneShot`, `Streaming` (rate-per-slot with pause/resume), or `DeliveryEscrow` (pinned merchant + dispute window + permissionless post-deadline release).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hash-committed receipts</b></summary>

Every `PolicyDecisionEvent` commits 3 × 32-byte BLAKE3 hashes on-chain (`receipt_hash`, `reason_hash`, `policy_snapshot_hash`). The off-chain `purpose_hash` binds them to HTTP context. `@settle/sdk::verifyReceipt` re-derives every hash from the canonical JSON in any environment that can run JS.

</details>

### Custody guarantees

- **Atomic checks in one ix.** Per-call cap, daily cap (cross-pact via parent card), allowlist, capability pin, expiry, revocation — all evaluated in the same instruction. No TOCTOU window between policy decision and transfer.
- **Slot-based cap window.** `CAP_WINDOW_SLOTS = 220_000` (~24h) cannot be exploited by validator clock manipulation.
- **Pinned merchant pubkey** in the DeliveryEscrow variant — permissionless release after deadline cannot redirect funds to an attacker.
- **Pinned USDC mint** at card-create time — spend rejects any other token, removing the spoofed-mint class of attack.

### On-chain bytecode verification

[`/verify-build`](https://use-settle.vercel.app/verify-build) exposes the deployed program's bytecode SHA-256, program data address, and upgrade authority straight from the chain. Anyone can rebuild the program with `cargo build-sbf` (or `anchor build --verifiable`) against the source and compare against the on-chain hash to confirm the deployment matches the repo. The committed build-info artifact is regenerated on every clean deploy.
